        God the Titanic. One of the largest tragedies, but so so so inspiring. 
        Makes me believe in humanity sometimes.

        Back here again. They really tried so hard. I went back there. I think maybe 
        people just didn't understand the scale of what it was. Everyone thought it would
        be ok.

        Yeah I know what you mean. I went twice, once on the actual boat and once on the 
        Carpathia. It feels impactful no matter what though.

        @xx_circular_xx I was in second class. I enjoyed it. I think we hear enough 
        about everyone in first class and it was nice seeing how everyone else fared 
        on here.
