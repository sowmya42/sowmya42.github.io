        Personally, I'm from the US, so I think about the American volcanoes a lot 
        there's a surprising number of active volcanoes

        Honestly not super worried about it @xx_circular_xx <br>
        I think the ones we need to worry about more are the actually active ones. The 
        chance of the Yellowstone one erupting is low, but for example st helens erupted 
        not nearly that long ago

        @astrogirl23 it's interesting that you bring up Mt. St. Helens! That's a volcano 
        that I actually visited. I think it's really interesting, there's a lot to think 
        about with it. I thought it was extraordinarily well handled, comparatively, there 
        wasn't a large loss of life.
