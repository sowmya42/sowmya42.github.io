        Now hypothetically if someone (not me) were to lose their time-traveller card,
        I would recommend always having the backup pendant on you. Maybe even in choker
        format. This way it's always on you no matter what. Sure it may not be following 
        the rules and you may start a couple new fashion trends, but at least you won't 
        be stranded in the 1600s.

        As much as you may want closure on who your parents were, sometimes it's better 
        not knowing! Found out my mom really was in a Mamma Mia-esque situation.

        @astrogirl23 my condolences. My personal advice is to avoid anything before the 
        1900s. I find the world far too different from what I'm used to and there's so 
        much in the 1900s to explore. Could spend a couple lifetimes just looking at that.
        AVOID THE WARS THOUGH
