        Yeah, but it's been like that for a while. I'd say there's really only about
        30 ish people who post regularly on here? Welcome though, I do see you're new.

        Ooh I actually know this one! The mods decided to keep some of these pages to 
        only show posts from the past 30 days, just because they thought this site would
        get way more traffic....

        yup @boatluvr_x is quite right here we did think the general chit-chat page would
        be far more trafficked and used than it actually is <br>

        maybe once we get more users?
