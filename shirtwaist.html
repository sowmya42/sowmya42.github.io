        this was such a tragic event and it killed me when I went to go see it and 
        couldn't help out at all

        Yeah I know what you're talking about. People survived and we got better regulations 
        but the cost was so unfair.

        I was raised watching that old show about the guy who time travelled and met 
        aliens and saved lives and watching this felt like the opposite of all of that

        Yeah I know what you mean. I was warned about that when I was being trained to

        and knowing that we aren't allowed to do anything about it.
