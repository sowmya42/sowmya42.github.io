        Thanks for the suggestion @time-again! Part of the charm of this site is its 
        ugliness. It hopefully deters people who haven't been told about the site from
        trying to use it more.

        @turtle_head you seem to be the only mod. What's up with that?

        Yes currently I am the only mod. There aren't a lot of users which means I don't 
        really have a lot of work to do.
